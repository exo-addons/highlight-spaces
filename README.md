Pin Spaces Add-on

With this addon, you can configure spaces to be pinned and displayed on the top of my spaces block.
To configure pinned spaces, add this property in gatein/conf/exo.properties exo.addons.pinnedSpaces=space1,space2,space3
You can set as many spaces you want. The space name must be the technical name of the space, not the displayed name.

Install
./addon install exo-pin-spaces
